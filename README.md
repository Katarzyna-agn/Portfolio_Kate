## About me

I have several years of experience in Quality Assurance and Development at an international company in the FMCG industry. In 2022 I have started to expand my skills in the field of software testing. I was a tester on test.io and since March 2023 I have worked as a software tester at a financial institution. At my work I learn a lot and improve my knowlage in software testing, I cooperate with developers, analitycs, project managers and people from the business area.
